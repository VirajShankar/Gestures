Control your web browser using only hand gestures! This computer vision project allows you to scroll, navigate, and click on web pages without touching your keyboard or mouse.

## Features

- ** Intuitive Cursor Control**: Control your mouse cursor by pointing with your index finger
- ** Smart Scrolling**: Scroll up or down by moving your hand to designated screen zones
- ** Natural Click Interaction**: Click by pinching your thumb and index finger together
- ** Real-time Visual Feedback**: On-screen indicators showing gesture recognition and actions

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Webcam
- Dependencies:
  - OpenCV
  - MediaPipe
  - PyAutoGUI

##  Project Structure
## âš™ How It Works

This project uses:
- **MediaPipe** for accurate hand landmark detection
- **OpenCV** for webcam access and visual interface
- **PyAutoGUI** to control mouse and keyboard actions

The application detects key points on your hand in real-time and translates specific gestures into computer inputs, allowing for touchless interaction with web content.

##  Customization

Adjust these variables in `gesture_control.py` to customize the experience:

- `scroll_amount`: Change scroll speed/distance
- `cooldown`: Adjust response sensitivity
- Scroll zone thresholds (currently at 30% and 70% of frame height)
